# Xamarin Forms MvvmCross Template

This is a project to build a Visual Studio 2017 extension to help you start developing with Xamarin.Forms 3.3 and MvvmCross 6.2

You can download the extension from [the Visual Studio gallery](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PaulDatsiuk.XamarinFormswithMvvmCross5SolutionTemplate) or [download VSIX from this repo](https://github.com/JTOne123/XamFormsMvxTemplate/blob/master/VSIXProject.vsix).

The previous version of VSIX for MvvmCross 5.5 is available by the following link [OldVSIX](https://github.com/JTOne123/XamFormsMvxTemplate/blob/mvvmcross_5.5/VSIXProject.vsix)

## What to expect

After installing the extension, when creating a new project in Visual Studio, you will be able to select a new template: Xamarin Forms with MvvmCross Solution Template. This will create the following projects:

* A Core Project (.NET Standard) will contain the Xamarin.Forms UI files, the View Models and a basic abstract repository class to work with any repository.
* An Android project
* An iOS project
* An Universal Windwos Platform project
* An UITest project
* An UnitTest project

Other small features that can be found in the project are:

* Localization
* Fody.PropertyChanged
* MvvmCross Forms approach example for Navigation, Logging, Android AppCompat, etc.
* Xamarin.Essentials
* Dialogs
* Logging (Serilog with Xamarin Sinks)
* Master-Detail
* Tabs
* xUnit (testing in VS and after build)
* UI Tests
* (will continue to add more interesting stuff)
